So let's start off with the like for like we always come with our guarantees. We have some really, really excellent guarantees that really just show you that we're going to do a great job for you. We then start off with our first cost. This is a newest nest thermostat. We can switch this up. I just wanted to just simplify it, put something in that you guys are used to. It will be just the most modern version. And then we credit this back towards replacement at the very end. So this 549 will be credited back towards you. Then we talk about steps like what we need to do. AC removal, hall away and disposal, heater and removal. This is a really lengthy section. This is like typically roughly one day, this amount of work we remove, safely, demolish and dispose of your furnace, remove safely, remove the refrigerant, demolish and dispose of your ac.

Any new thermostat, wiring or connections, any new electrical whips, we install that for you. We have circuit breakers on the ac. We just prefer to have a brand new circuit breaker. So we just include that with it. Thermostat wire, communication wire. This just means if there is a need to rerun a thermostat wire, we absolutely would. And then H Vac permanent.

So we love to do HERS tests. But in order for us to feel confident in doing that, we would need to do a little bit with your ducting or consider modifying it. What that would look like is something. We do have a promotion going on currently is sealing your ductwork, which just means no replacement. But we go to every single connection and seal it thoroughly and then we can include a test. If we do that next. This is the total cost of four R&E discounts. I do have a fair amount of discounts that I've included. This is again the like for like option. And just to explain what it comes with, I explained R410A. The refrigerant got phased out. We have the newest style here, R32. This is basically just the new standard for refrigerant. It is considered to be better for the environment. It's just much less harmful to ozone layers in general. 35% cooling savings, 30% heating savings. It is going to be the same similar type of technology. The sear rating is up. You currently have a 12 seer. We install a 15 and then we always include standard filtration for you as basic. The motor is an improvement. So the fan motor inside of the system is an improvement. Way more reliable and way quieter. That's basically what this comes with now. A really cool thing. 10 year manufacturer warranty, 10 year compressor warranties. If you're on this maintenance program with us, we actually completely match the manufacturer warranties. It's essentially 10 years parts and 10 year manufacturer warranty. And then moving on, we'll just get to the first heat pump. Really very similar line items. I'm not going to go through every single one this time. I wanted to pause at this one though. The technology we're talking about with this heat pump is called an inverter.

So the main difference here just important to realize that it's going to heat and cool a little bit differently. In general, everything is going to be an improvement. Cooling will be significantly better. Usually we're talking like 60% utility bill savings. The thing about heating side, it's just important to note usually they don't absolutely kill it the same way old furnaces do. Old furnaces have flames. So obviously we're going to get really intense temperature coming out. These do heat a little bit less extreme, but still are totally capable of."

But starting off, this existed on your other estimate too, is $1,800 off because we're able to reuse the copper line set. Very resilient to timing corrosion. If my install crew does determine that your H Vac leak that you have right now is in your copper line, we just still take care of it. But even with this savings in place, next, we have the thermostat credit back towards you. And this is where we have some rebates. So Silicon Valley Clean Energy.

So we handle what we need to handle. There are things that you need to physically go in and do. The only one for the SVCE is you do. And this will be in a contract that you can just click on easily.

So we like to install them. But what's interesting is Bryant does have a corner on a type of technology. Heat pumps, on occasion enter a defrost cycle, which is where it briefly stops heating and it just runs itself alone to heat itself back up. These are known to not really enter that.

So just to explain an attic install, that intake would no longer be used. We would add one probably close to the center of the house. And our systems are very quiet.

These two are our most commonly used. Good leap, actually just barely just gave us access to this this month. It was supposed to end on the 15th, so I'm surprised it's still going on. But the 12 months, no interest just means that if you do pay it off in 12 months, you just pay the same as cash. Like there's no interest rate or anything.

The other thing is we can see what options you qualify for in regards to financing. And if that's the case, if we have financing, then I don't even need a down payment today. We would just do just the financing side of it. And we do come with. Every contractor that's reputable comes with this guarantee here.
